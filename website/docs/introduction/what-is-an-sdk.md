SDKs, or software development kits, provide developers with the code necessary to interact with an underlying system (often APIs). Viewing SDKs as just code libraries misses many vital aspects that "kit" implies. SDKs do include code libraries, but they also have relevant documentation, code examples, developer guides, additional tools (i.e., compiler, debuggers, etc), and other supplementary materials. SDKs won't build your API integration for you; instead, they provide building blocks to accelerate development.

You can compare SDKs to a Lego set with all the necessary parts and step-by-step assembly instructions. A Lego set is a fair analogy, as SDKs are purpose-built with the components and supporting materials to help you complete a task. SDKs help developers with standard operations so they can focus on the business logic and features unique to their applications.

Let's clarify some standard terms that describe SDKs.

## Code libraries​
Code libraries refer to pre-written code modules provided to developers as part of the SDK. These code libraries contain functions, classes, and methods that developers can easily integrate into an application to interact with an API.

You can write code libraries in various programming languages and design them to make it easier for developers to access and use the API by providing pre-built functionality. Code libraries are the heart of your SDK, along with other resources to help developers integrate with the API.

Using code libraries from an SDK can save developers a significant amount of time and effort compared to building everything from scratch. With code libraries, developers can quickly implement core functionality for interacting with the API and then customize and extend this functionality to meet their specific needs.

## SDK documentation​
It's essential to provide developers with clear and comprehensive documentation that explains how to use the SDK effectively. SDK-specific documentation is different from API reference documentation in several ways.

SDK-specific documentation guides how to use the SDK to interact with the API. It explains the SDK's purpose and how to use its functions and methods to perform specific tasks. It should also guide the SDK's error-handling mechanisms and how to debug any issues that arise during SDK usage.

On the other hand, API reference documentation provides technical details on the API's endpoints, parameters, responses, and error codes. It's more technical documentation that describes the specific HTTP requests and responses required to interact with the API.
SDK-specific documentation may also provide code examples and tutorials illustrating how to use the SDK to achieve specific tasks. The code examples should be easy to follow, and they should cover all the essential use cases of the API.

Additionally, SDK-specific documentation should explain any requirements for using the SDK, such as system requirements, dependencies, and prerequisites. It should also outline any authentication mechanisms required to access the API.

## Code examples​
Code examples illustrate how to use the SDK's functions and methods to interact with the API. They show developers how to authenticate, make requests, and handle responses in different programming languages. By providing code snippets demonstrating how to use the SDK, developers can quickly learn how to use it, saving time and effort.
Code examples also serve as a reference point for developers when they're stuck or unsure how to use a particular feature or functionality. They can refer to code examples for a solution and adapt the code to their needs.

Good code examples should be clear, concise, and well-documented. They should cover a broad range of use cases, including primary and advanced scenarios, and illustrate best practices for using the SDK. The examples should also be accessible and easy to find and are well-suited to the SDK documentation.

## Getting started guides​
Getting started (aka quick start guides) are essential resources for helping developers learn how to use the SDKs quickly and effectively. These guides provide a step-by-step introduction to the SDK, including how to install and set up the SDK, authenticate with the API, and make basic requests.

The importance of these guides lies in their ability to reduce the learning curve for developers. They offer a clear, concise, and structured introduction to the SDK, which can save developers significant time and effort. By providing a quick overview of the SDK's key features and functionalities, getting started guides can help developers gain a better understanding of how to use the SDK.

Moreover, these guides help developers get up and running with the SDK quickly, even if unfamiliar with the underlying API. These guides often include code examples and step-by-step instructions, making it easy for developers to follow along and start building their applications immediately.

## Use case guides​
Use case guides, also known as recipes, are step-by-step instructions that explain how to use an SDK to accomplish a specific task or solve a particular problem. They typically include code snippets, explanations of each step, and any necessary configuration or setup instructions.
Use case guides can be incredibly helpful for developers who are new to using an SDK or who are unfamiliar with the particular API. By providing a clear, concise, and well-organized set of instructions, case guides can help developers save time and avoid frustration by guiding them through the process of using the SDK to accomplish their desired task.

## Conclusion​
In conclusion, a software development kit (SDK) gives developers the code to interact with an underlying system or API. SDKs include code libraries, documentation, code examples, developer guides, and additional tools to accelerate development. Code libraries are pre-written code modules that provide pre-built functionality, while SDK documentation guides how to use the SDK effectively. Code examples illustrate how to use the SDK's functions and methods to interact with the API, and getting started, guides provide a step-by-step introduction to the SDK. Use case guides are step-by-step instructions that explain how to use an SDK to accomplish a specific task or solve a particular problem.
