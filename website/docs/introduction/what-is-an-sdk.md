SDKs, software development kits, provide developers the code necessary to interact with an underlying system (often APIs). SDKs are sometimes viewed as just code libraries, but the term “kit” implies more. SDKs do include code libraries, but they also have relevant documentation, code examples, developer guides, additional tools (i.e. compiler, debuggers, etc) and other supplementary materials. SDKs won’t build your API integration for you, instead they provide building blocks to accelerate development.

You can compare SDKs to a lego set with all the parts you need and step by step assembly instructions. This is a fair analogy, as SDKs are purpose built with the parts and supporting materials to help you complete a task. SDKs help developers with standard operations, so they can focus on the business logic and features unique to their application. 

Let's define some common terms you'll see when SDKs are discussed.

## Code libraries
Code libraries refer to pre-written code modules that are provided to developers as part of the SDK. These code libraries contain sets of functions, classes, and methods that can be easily integrated into a developer's application code to interact with the API.

Code libraries can be written in various programming languages and are designed to make it easier for developers to access and use the API by providing pre-built functionality. These libraries are typically provided as part of the SDK, which includes other resources to help developers integrate with the API.

Using code libraries from an SDK can save developers a significant amount of time and effort compared to building everything from scratch. With code libraries, developers can quickly implement core functionality for interacting with the API, and then customize and extend this functionality as needed to meet their specific needs.

## SDK documentation
 It's essential to provide developers with clear and comprehensive documentation that explains how to use the SDK effectively. SDK-specific documentation is different from API reference documentation in several ways.

SDK-specific documentation provides guidance on how to use the SDK to interact with the API. It explains the SDK's purpose, how it's organized, and how to use its functions and methods to perform specific tasks. It should also provide guidance on the SDK's error handling mechanisms and how to debug any issues that arise during SDK usage.

On the other hand, API reference documentation provides technical details on the API's endpoints, parameters, responses, and error codes. It's a more technical documentation that describes the specific HTTP requests and responses required to interact with the API.

SDK-specific documentation may also provide code examples and tutorials that illustrate how to use the SDK to achieve specific tasks. The examples should be easy to follow, and they should cover all the essential use cases of the API.

Additionally, SDK-specific documentation should explain any requirements for using the SDK, such as system requirements, dependencies, and prerequisites. It should also outline any authentication mechanisms required to access the API.

## Code examples 
Code examples illustrate how to use the SDK's functions and methods to interact with the API. They show developers how to authenticate, make requests, and handle responses in different programming languages. By providing code snippets that demonstrate how to use the SDK, developers can quickly learn how to use it, saving time and effort.

Code examples also serve as a reference point for developers when they're stuck or unsure about how to use a particular feature or functionality. They can refer to the examples to see how similar problems have been solved, and adapt the code to their specific needs.

Good code examples should be clear, concise, and well-documented. They should cover a broad range of use cases, including basic and advanced scenarios, and illustrate best practices for using the SDK. The examples should also be accessible and easy to find, and are well suited in the SDK documentation.

## Getting started guides
Getting started (aka quick start guides) are essential resources for helping developers learn how to use the SDKs quickly and effectively. These guides provide a step-by-step introduction to the SDK, including how to install and set up the SDK, authenticate with the API, and make basic requests.

The importance of these guides lies in their ability to reduce the learning curve for developers. They offer a clear, concise, and structured introduction to the SDK, which can save developers significant time and effort. By providing a quick overview of the SDK's key features and functionalities, getting started guides can help developers gain a better understanding of what the SDK can do and how it can be used.

Moreover, these guides can help developers get up and running with the SDK quickly, even if they're not familiar with the underlying API or programming language. These guides often include code examples and step-by-step instructions, making it easy for developers to follow along and start building their applications right away.

## Use case guides
Use case guides, also known as recipes, are step-by-step instructions that explain how to use an SDK to accomplish a specific task or solve a particular problem. They typically include code snippets, explanations of each step, and any necessary configuration or setup instructions.

Use case guides can be incredibly helpful for developers who are new to using an SDK or who are unfamiliar with the particular API that the SDK is designed to consume. By providing a clear, concise, and well-organized set of instructions, case guides can help developers save time and avoid frustration by guiding them through the process of using the SDK to accomplish their desired task.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, a software development kit (SDK) provides developers with the code necessary to interact with an underlying system or API. SDKs include code libraries, documentation, code examples, developer guides, and additional tools to accelerate development. Code libraries are pre-written code modules that provide pre-built functionality, while SDK documentation provides guidance on how to use the SDK effectively. Code examples illustrate how to use the SDK's functions and methods to interact with the API, and getting started guides provide a step-by-step introduction to the SDK. Use case guides are step-by-step instructions that explain how to use an SDK to accomplish a specific task or solve a particular problem.
